# Redux FAQ : Store Setup
- Can or should I create multiple stores? Can I import my store directly, and use it in components myself?
- Is it OK to have more than one middleware chain in my store enhancer? What is the difference between next and dispatch in a middleware function?
- How do I subscribe to only a portion of the state?  Can I get the dispathched action as part of the subscription?
